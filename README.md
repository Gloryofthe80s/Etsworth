Etsworth
========

I made Etsworth as a fun “game” site that takes real users’ art from Etsy and has the user guess which painting is more expensive. It was a proof of concept, mostly; much more could be done with it, but it’s functional as is. The site pulls data from Etsy’s API (well, actually I wrote a Node server to make the calls to Etsy) and then, after being curated, feeds the data to the front end where I used Backbone to render the views dynamically in a single page app.
